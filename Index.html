            <h2>Complex Cases Handled by the Hospital</h2>
            <p>Dharmshilla Narayana Superspeciality Hospital has successfully managed numerous complex medical cases, earning a reputation for excellence in patient care. Some of the notable cases include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case 1:Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Metasta</strong> </li>
					<h3>Patient Background:</h3>
					<p>A 58-year-old male presented with persistent cough, shortness of breath, and unexplained weight loss. He was a long-term smoker with a history of chronic bronchitis.</p>
					<h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
					<p>Imaging studies, including a CT scan and PET scan, revealed a large mass in the right lung with metastases to the lymph nodes and liver. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), specifically adenocarcinoma.</p>
					<h3>Treatment:</h3>
					<p>The oncology team at Dharmshilla Narayana Superspeciality Hospital devised a personalized treatment plan involving a combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. He was started on Erlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the EGFR mutation identified in his tumor, along with Nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor.</p>
					<h3>Outcome:</h3>
					<p>After six months of treatment, follow-up imaging showed a significant reduction in the size of the primary tumor and metastatic lesions. His symptoms improved markedly, and he experienced fewer side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. He continues to receive maintenance therapy and regular monitoring.</p>
                <li><strong>Case 2:Small Cell Lung Cancer with Brain Metastasis</strong> </li>
					<h3>Patient Background:</h3>
					<p>A 65-year-old female, presented with severe headaches, dizziness, and difficulty in coordination. She had a history of smoking but had quit 20 years prior.</p>
					<h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
					<p>MRI of the brain showed multiple lesions suggestive of metastases. A subsequent CT scan of the chest revealed a small mass in the left lung. A biopsy confirmed Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), and the brain lesions were determined to be metastatic.</p>
					<h3>Treatment:</h3>
					<p>Given the aggressive nature of SCLC, she was started on a regimen of chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Etoposide. Concurrently, she underwent whole-brain radiotherapy to address the brain metastases.</p>
					<h3>Outcome:</h3>
					<p>After completing the initial rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, follow-up scans indicated a partial response with a reduction in the size of both the primary lung tumor and brain metastases. Her neurological symptoms improved significantly, and she continues to receive maintenance chemotherapy with close neurological monitoring.</p>
                <li><strong>Case 3: Early-Stage Lung Cancer Treated with Surgery</strong></li>
					<h3>Patient Background:</h3>
					<p>A 52-year-old non-smoker, was incidentally found to have a suspicious lesion in the right upper lobe of the lung during a routine health check-up.</p>
					<h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
					<p>A high-resolution CT scan confirmed a solitary nodule, and a biopsy was performed, which revealed Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), specifically squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
					<h3>Treatment:</h3>
					<p>Given the early stage of the cancer, the multidisciplinary team at Dharmshilla Narayana Superspeciality Hospital recommended surgical resection. He underwent a successful lobectomy, removing the affected portion of the lung.</p>
					<h3>Outcome:</h3>
